# MTG_Color_Analysis
This is a bit of a passion project of mine. Here, I'm attempting to predict future results for my Magic: the Gathering color identity as measured by a semi-popular online quiz (https://still-anchorage-15218.herokuapp.com/) through use of two machine learning algorithms: support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees (DT). To briefly summarize, the colors in Magic: the Gathering each represent different facets of magic and its relationship to values. For example, green values acceptance and nature, while red values freedom and action. The aforementioned quiz measures one's affinity for the values of each color and returns the user's color identity in percentages. 
I have trained the models both on the full spread of colors as well as on each of the five individual colors. Interestingly, the SVM seems to more closely fit the mean results for an example date, while the DT seems to miss the mean at times but maintains the lower mean square error.
